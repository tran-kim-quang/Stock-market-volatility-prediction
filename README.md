Test two models: Random Forest and Long Short Term Memory to see which model is better at predicting stock price movements.

Use two input variables, closing price and volume, in the data set to predict stock price movements in the coming days.

The input variable will be averaged by the closing price and volume for that day and the output variable will also be filtered by the daily average, which will then take the average of each day's price movement.

The model will show relative stock price fluctuations to help investors consider their investments more carefully.
